Resumo de Mecanismos de Transferência Confiável de Dados e suas Utilizações


	MECHANISM 							USE, COMMENTS

Checksum 			Used to detect bit errors in a transmitted packet.

Timer 				Used to timeout/retransmit a packet, possibly because the packet (or its ACK) was lost within the channel. Because
    				timeouts can occur when a packet is delayed but not lost (premature timeout), or when a packet has been received by the
  				receiver but the receiver-to-sender ACK  as been lost, duplicate copies of a packet may be received by a receiver.

Sequence 			number Used for sequential numbering of packets of data flowing from sender to receiver.

Gaps 				in the sequence numbers of received packets allow the receiver to detect a lost packet. Packets with duplicate sequence
 				numbers allow the receiver to detect duplicate copies of a packet.

Acknowledgment 			Used by the receiver to tell the sender that a packet or set of packets has been received correctly. Acknowledgments will
				typically carry the sequence number of the packet or packets being acknowledged. Acknowledgments may be individual or
				cumulative, depending on the protocol.

Negative acknowledgment 	Used by the receiver to tell the sender that a packet has not been received correct- ly. Negative acknowledgments will 
				typically carry the sequence number of the packet that was not received correctly.

Window, pipelining 		The sender may be restricted to sending only packets with sequence numbers that fall within a given range. By allowing 
				multiple packets to be transmitted but not yet acknowledged, sender utilization can be increased over a stop-and-wait 
				mode of operation. We’ll see shortly that the window size may be set on the basis of the receiver’s ability to receive 
				and buffer messages, or the level of congestion in the network, or both.
